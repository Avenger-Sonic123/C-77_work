<h3>Visual Studio</h3>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on the microsoft/vscode repository of GitHub using the "Code – OSS" name, under the permissive MIT License, while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.
In the Stack Overflow 2019 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool, with 50.7% of 87,317 respondents reporting that they use it.
Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A Preview build was released shortly thereafter.
On November 18, 2015, Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License, having its source code available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced. On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the Web.

<h3>Console web page</h3>
<p>Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. 
    To log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript.
     When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console.
    
     The Console is also a REPL (Read–eval–print loop). You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting.
     Modifying the page from the Console is possible because the Console has full access to the page. 
     DevTools has a few convenience functions that make it easier to inspect a page.
     When you run JavaScript you don't have to interact with the page. You can use the Console to try out new code that's not related to the page.
